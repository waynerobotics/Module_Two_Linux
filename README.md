# Module Two: Linux (Basics)

## Introduction

In this module you will be introduced to Linux and some of the basic commands that can be performed in the terminal. Just like GitHub, this is another important tool that we use in the lab. All of our devices run on Ubuntu (Linux distro) including our competition robot! So it is very important that you become familiar with Linux and using the basic commands. We will also provide you with references and more material on Linux for you to explore.

## Tutorial Video
Please watch the video below by clicking on the image. You may skip the part on Installing Linux (unless you are interested). The usb flash drives and PC's in the lab all run on Linux, so you will not have to worry about installing it. 

*Disclaimer: We do not recommend installing Linux on your device, but please be careful if you decide to do so. If it is not done properly, it could result in loss of data or further damage.*

## Assignment

Now that you have the basics of Linux down, let's put it to the test! If you need help, refer back to the video or the referenced material provided below. Notify a team lead when you have completed your assignment.

Please refer to this site for assistance with this assignment: [Ubuntu Screenshots](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-take-screenshots-on-ubuntu/)

```
1.  Sign into your GitHub Account.

2.  Go to your repository: <YourName>_Training_Modules

3.  Create a new branch called: Module2

4.  Edit your Readme file in the Module2 branch and format it using the following:
      - Please use a 5 line gap after the previous assignment
      - The first line: "<YourName> Module Two" using H1 (header one)
      - The third line: "Answers:" using H2 (header two)
      - The fifth line: Start an ordered List (1.)

5.  Answer the following questions by typing your short answers into the ordered list you created on line 5:
      a. What command is used to display the current working directory?
      b. How do you create a new directory in Linux?
      c. What command is used to list files and directories in the current directory?
      d. How do you navigate to the parent directory in the Linux terminal?
      e. What command is used to copy files in Linux? (You may provide an example as your answer)

6.  Almost done! Now, you will need to use the terminal to complete the steps below:
      - Open a terminal.
      - Create a directory on your desktop called "Module2".
      - Enter the Module2 directory, create a txt file, and name it after your favorite band/singer. [Hint: use the touch command]
      - Using the echo command, enter a message into the file. The message should contain your favorite songs by the chosen band/singer.
      - To display your message, use the cat command.
      - Take a screenshot of your terminal using one of the methods provided in the reference above.
      - Include the screenshot a few lines below your last answer.

7.  Commit your changes by clicking the 'Commit changes...' button and set the commit message to "Completed Task Two"

8.  Go back to the code tab once you've committed your changes, and click the green button labeled 'Compare & pull request'

9.  Fill in the pull request:
    - Title: Task two
    - Comment: [ Please write a one-two sentence summary of what you did for this assignment ]
    - Assignees: [ Choose team lead member who is overseeing modules ]
```
